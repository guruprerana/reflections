1.Q. When would you want to use a remote repository 
rather than keeping all your work local?
When we want share and collaborate our project.
OR
When many people are working on the same project.
OR
We are creating an open source project.

2.Q Why might you want to always pull changes manually
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?
We might not always want to pull all the changes
introduced. When we do it manually we can choose
which changes we want to be incorporated in our
local computer.

Commands:

git remote  |    Show all remote locations for the repository
git remote add origin url |     Add a new remote location for the repository. Origin is the default name to use when you create only one remote location. Url should be the https url to the github repository.
git remove -v  |    Outputs the remote locations with verbose information (fetch and push urls)
git push origin master  |    Push the master branch to the remote location origin.
git pull origin master  |    Get the master branch from the remote location origin.
git pull origin master  |    = Git fetch origin + git merge master origin/master
git fetch origin  |    Get the changes from the remote location into the (hidden?) origin/master branch
