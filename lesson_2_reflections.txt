1.Q. What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository, it creates a new
folder called .git to keep all the commits and
previous versions.

2.Q. How is the staging area different from the 
working directory and the repository? What value 
do you think it offers?
The staging area is the preparation area for a
commit. It prepares the file so that it can be
changed in the working directory or repository.

3.Q. How can you use the staging area to make 
sure you have one commit per logical change?
Once you make a small change, you can add it
to the staging area. Then you can even check
out what change you have made by using diff
to compare with working directory. You can
keep adding small changes to the staging
and can commit when you finish a logical change.
